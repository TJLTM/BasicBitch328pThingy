# BasicBitch328pThingy

This is a basic Bitch. 
Made with the Atmel 328p DIP model 
Has 3 Buffered inputs
Has 3 VDC outputs 
Pulled out the remaining pins for 
ability to add other things. I'd 
rate the Outputs ~ 1A a piece 
but probably shouldn't do that 
traces won't handle it. Design 
it for triggering 12 volt 
relays.
